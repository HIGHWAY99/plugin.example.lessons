## <addon id="" >
* Gone over in Lesson 02
An id tag that can be used to call this 
addon, that is used to identify this 
addon and no other addon generally.

## <addon name="" >
* Gone over in Lesson 02
The text label that will show for this 
addon when you find it on the addon's 
list for "Video Addon" in this case.

## <addon provider-name="" >
This tends to hold the names of the 
developer(s) who worked on the project 
and/or a group name or site name that 
the project is made for.

## <addon version="" >

The current version number of this 
addon's project.  Used to tell a part 
different updates of a project.

## <requires>

Any modules that are to be imported, 
now have to be listed in this section.  
This section is used in part to see what 
other addon projects need to be installed 
when installing this addon.  If the addon 
is said to be incompatible, it may be 
having a problem locating a project 
listed in this section or something in 
this section doesn't match the requirements 
of version of xbmc/kodi that the user has 
installed.

For example, at one point xbmc, at that 
time, set a forced requirement for all 
addons to make people to update their 
installed version of xbmc by using:

<import addon="xbmc.python" version="2.1.0"/>

That also shows an example of using the 
"version" tag, to say that it needs 
atleast a minimum of that version number 
or higher.

This can be used to require an addon to be 
installed when installing this project:

<import addon="script.module.t0mm0.common" />

While this method can be used to set the 
optional use of an addon:

<import addon="script.module.addon.common" optional="true" />

## <extension point="xbmc.addon.metadata">

This area allows you to provide users with useful information.

#### <extension library="">

Generally "default.py", this is the 
file name in the addon's root folder 
which is ran by default when the addon 
is called to be started initially.

This can also be a folder name such as 
"lib", when doing a project such as an 
module(s) to be imported later by other 
addons.

#### <extension point="">

## xbmc.ui.screensaver

Used when making a screensaver.

## xbmc.python.module

Used when making an package with 
module(s) that can then be imported 
by other addons.

## xbmc.python.pluginsource

Uses the built-in folder-view styled by 
the currently used skin in xbmc/kodi.

## xbmc.python.script

Simular to a script or program being 
launched, this method instead of using 
the built-in folder-view default method, 
instead allows you to customize things, 
use your own skinned window and control 
what happens when the user clicks or 
takes some other action... rather than 
reloading an addon, passing information, 
over and over each click... this method 
allows you to keep variables and such 
active until the addon is closed.



#### <provides></provides>
