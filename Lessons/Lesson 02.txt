#### Naming

It's best to stay on good terms with 
other developers in general.  So, it's 
best to be friendly when naming 
projects.  There's 2 names you need 
to think about when creating an addon.  

The first is the Addon's Name / Title.  
This is the label text you see when 
browsing a list of addon's.  This 
doesn't hurt as much to be the same as 
on another addon.  Accidents can 
happen after all.  Some People even 
like to include colored text in this 
by using 
[COLOR red]Addon's Name[/COLOR].  The 
Addon's name is placed in the addon's 
folder in the file, addon.xml, inside 
of 
<addon ... name="Addon's Name" ... >.  

The second name is the Addon's ID.  
This is generally both used as the 
name of the addon's FOLDER and also 
put in the file, addon.xml, inside of 
<addon ... id="Addon's ID" ... >.  An 
Addon's ID usually looks like 
"plugin.video.example" or 
"skin.example" or 
"script.module.example".
It is important that a developer tries 
to keep an Addon's ID generic, in 
other words, make sure that no one 
else is currently using it.  Even if 
your forking an existing project, it 
be nice to tweak the Addon's ID 
slightly, so to not cause conflicts 
with other addons or their developer(s).  
Even if you just add a .tag like 
"plugin.video.tag.example" with the 
"tag" being a personalized tag that you 
can use for your own stuff down the line.
