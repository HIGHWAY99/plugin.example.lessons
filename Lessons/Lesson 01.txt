######## Lesson 01
#### References

First thing to is some good place to 
catch references from while learning.

Easiest way is to look at other addon(s) 
that already exist and work on the 
platform you want to make stuff for.

## Google - http://www.google.com/
You can always do a google search for 
the 2 words, python syntax, and whatever 
you want the to look up.  You can often 
times find some good how-to information 
and examples.  Here's 2 sites that often 
come up on searches:

## Python Docs - https://docs.python.org/2/library/
## Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/

You can find a lot of Addon projects on 
common hosts, which make for decent 
reference when doing a simular project.  
Google Code seems to be closing and will 
likely be gone by some point in August, 
2015.  Some may use dropbox, bitbucket 
or other such hosts.  One main host 
that's good to look at is Github.  You 
can also find a lot of projects at 
xbmc.org / kodi.tv own repository(s) 
which tends to have a system that's 
basically like an FTP Hosting, with 
several mirror servers.  You can also 
check out SuperRepo.
